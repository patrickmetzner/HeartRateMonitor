# Heart Rate Monitor

This project was made just for fun. The goal of this project was to develop a Heart Rate Monitor app. to make my indoor bike training sessions a little more interesting. 

# About the project

The app uses accelerometer data sent by an STM32 microcontroller (mounted to a chest strap - image below) to the PC via Bluetooth (Bluetooth module attached to the USB port) to make the appropriate data manipulation, calculate the Heart Rate and then display useful information to the user, like calories burnt and Heart Rate Zone (according to user's age, gender and weight). The user can also change the sensibility to filter the raw accelerometer data before the Heart Rate calculation takes place.

The app shown below was developed using **MATLAB's App Designer** tool.
