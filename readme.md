# Heart Rate Monitor

The goal of this project was to develop a Heart Rate Monitor app. 

# About the project

The app uses accelerometer data sent by an STM32 microcontroller (mounted to a chest strap - image below) to the PC via Bluetooth (Bluetooth module attached to the USB port) toÂ make the appropriate data manipulation, calculate the Heart Rate and then display useful information to the user.

The app shown below was developed using **MATLAB's App Designer** tool.
